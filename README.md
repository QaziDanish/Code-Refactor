Hello guys,
This is the refactor assignment where I have refactored deterministicPartitionKey function and wrote test cases to validate the results of both refactored and original function
Refactored function is available in file 'deterministicPartitionKey_Refactored.js' along with the description of refactored code

to run the test cases just run the command 'npm test'  
all the test cases are written in index.test.js and you guys can apply the test cases on both original and refactored function by commenting one or another.

Thanks
